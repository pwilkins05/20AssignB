Yahtzee Rules

In Yahtzee, players take turns rolling a set of five dice, then assign those dice to a category in which they are scored.

// Todo: turn description

Scoring: After each turn's final roll you do you then assign that roll to a scoring category. In order to score any points in the category you muss fulfill the category's rule. Each category has a deferent rule and is scored deferently and can only be used once. If you assign a roll to a category that doesn't fulfill the that rule, it will earn you zero points. You also cannot move rolls or trade rolls from one category to another, you can only use each catigoary once and cannot change the roll when you commit it.

Upper section:


Categories are ones, twos, threes, fours, fives, and sixes.  In each category, to number of points scored is equal to the 
total number of pips on those dice.  For example, if your rolled three 4s, that would score 12 in the fours category.

Brandon's addition:
In the upper scores, you total only the specified die face. So if you roll:
<3> <3> <4> <3> <6>
and score in the Threes category, your total for that entry would be 9. This same roll would yield zero points if you scored it in the Aces (Ones), Twos, or Fives category, four points if you scored it in the Fours category, or six points if you scored it in the Sixes category.
When the game is over, if you score 63 or more upper points (an average of 3 die faces per category), you will get an upper bonus of 35 points. Of course do don't need to score exactly three die faces in each upper category to get the bonus, as long as the upper total is at least 63.
