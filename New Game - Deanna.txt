Proposal for a dice game 

One game I like to play is called, "Ship, Captain, Crew".  Any number of players can be in a round and rounds are very fast.  It's simple to play and the speed of play keeps it interesting.

Player has 5 dice and keeps the sixes, only.  The first 6 is the ship, the second is the captain and the third is the crew.  The remaining dice can be rerolled 2 more times to get the highest possible score.  There is no score if the player gets fewer than 3 sixes, and the total of the last two dice is the score if there are at least 3 sixes.

This game will be easy to program using the same reroll method as Yahtzee, but we will need to add more multiplayer functionality.
